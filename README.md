# CASPR

Caspr is a configurable assembler program, originally developed for an
undergraduate course at [URI](http://www.ele.uri.edu/Courses/ele405/). While
fairly simple, it makes quick work of small assembler jobs for student
microprocessors, and is very easy to port by means of a short configuration file.

It has seen some use outside of URI
([link](https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/59975/1/000135086.pdf)).
And while not as featureful as some other assemblers, it makes quick work of small
jobs, such as those in HDL processor design.

For those interested, the original lab handout is included in the doc directory.
